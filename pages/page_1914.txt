主 题/Title：Machine Learning for Empirical Asset Pricing
内容简介/ Abstract：
Over the years, top journals have published hundreds of characteristics to explain stock return, but many have lost significance. What fundamentally affects the time-varying significance of characteristics that survive? We combine machine-learning (ML) and portfolio analysis to uncover patterns in significant characteristics. From out-of- sample portfolio analysis, we back out important characteristics that ML models uncover. The ML portfolio’s exposure alternates between investor arbitrage constraint and firm financial constraint characteristics, the timing of which aligns with credit contraction and expansion states.

In the first part of the presentation, summarize some of the papers on this topic while explaining my working paper outlined above. In the second part, show how to use Wharton Research Data Services cloud computing environment.
