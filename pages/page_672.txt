  UBC Vancouver Summer Program 2023
We are excited to announce the Vancouver Summer Program (VSP) dates for summer 2023!  As you may know, the VSP is a wonderful opportunity for undergraduate students to study at the beautiful University of British Columbia, Vancouver Campus. By offering globally relevant academic courses and sociocultural activities specific to Vancouver and its surroundings, the VSP encourages students to engage in cross-disciplinary learning and develop their understanding of Canadian culture and values.
Please mark these dates on your calendar:
lJune Session: June 2 to July 2, 2023 (Application deadline: April 29, 2023)
lJuly Session: July 14 to August 14, 2023 (Application deadline: June 10, 2023)
 This year we will be offering over 70 course packages in a range of disciplines.  Application requirements for each program, fees, and other relevant information can be found on our website at www.vancouversummerprogram.ubc.ca.
We invite your students to study at North America’s most international University and connect with other globally-minded students.  On-line applications for students will be accepted starting November 15, 2022 through our website, or if you interested in sending a group, please contact us at vsp.ubc@ubc.ca.  Please note that should your institution send 24 or more students to our program, VSP will sponsor a chaperone to come along with your group.  Our sponsorship covers each chaperone’s accommodation, medical insurance, and chaperone-specific events throughout the duration of the program.
