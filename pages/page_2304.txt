 讲座摘要：Lanthanide-doped luminescent nanoparticles enable anti-Stokes emission via nonlinear processes, where low energy excitation photons in the near-infrared window can be upconverted into high-energy emission ones in the visible or ultraviolet regions. The past decade has seen great success in the high-quality synthesis of luminescent nanoparticles with controlled structure, crystalline phase, size, and shape. The unique capacity of upconversion nanocrystals to undertake near-infrared excitation, amalgamated with their excellent luminescent characteristics, such as massive anti-Stokes spectral shift, sharp emission band, multicolor emission, and long luminescence lifetime, makes these nanomaterials prime candidates for a plethora of applications. Herein, we present luminescent nanoparticles from the perspective of fundamental luminescence mechanisms, describe new synthetic routes for expanding the chemist’s repertoire, and summarize current practical approaches to tuning emission color and enhancing upconversion efficiency. In particular, we highlight the recent advances in utilizing luminescent nanocrystals for bioimaging, therapy, biosensing, neuroscience, super-resolution imaging, photoswitching, and lasing applications. We also discuss the key challenges and issues that are critical for the further implementation of luminescent nanoparticles in diverse settings.
