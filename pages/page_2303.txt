讲座摘要：Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been known to display unique localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property, which could be utilized to significantly enhance optical responses of metal NPs themselves and nearby chromophores, such as Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), metal enhanced fluorescence and Plasmon enhanced nonlinear optical (NLO) responses. In this talk, I will present our group’s efforts on aggregation induced optical properties (photothermal effects and emission) of metal nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Taking advantages of giant local electric amplification of plasmon coupled nanostructures, we have developed a new type of AIE based on aggregation of metal-chromophore conjugates. The working principle of this new AIE scheme is based on aggregation induced plasmon coupling of metal NPs that help to enhance the excitation efficiency and emission quantum yield at the same time. We have further developed photosensitizer conjugated gold NPs that display significantly enhanced fluorescence, singlet oxygen generation and photothermal response, which allow applications for multimodal imaging and synergistic photothermal and photodynamic cancer therapy.
