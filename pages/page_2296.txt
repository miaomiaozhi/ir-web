报告简介：This talk starts with a Review of a recent trend in polariton lasing. Then, the speaker will present a realization of room-temperature polariton lasing in RhB-based MOFs by his research group for the first time. With multiphoton absorption pumping, the lowest the lasing threshold observed up to date. 
嘉宾简介：Wei Ji received his PhD degree in Physics at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland in 1986. After the experience of three-year post-doctor at the same university, he moved to National University of Singapore as Lecturer, Associate Professor, and Full Professor.　He was the Vice Dean of Science Faculty, National University of Singapore for seven years. He was an Associate Editor of Optical Materials Express. 　His current research interests include nonlinear optical materials, especially low-dimensional semiconductors and organics, and their technological applications for optical switching, optical limiting, lasing, and optical detection.
